# Hydrologic and Isotopic Mass Balance Lake Model
This repository contains scripts and functions to produce the results in Fernandez et al., 2024. It runs the proxy systems model described in the article as well as the calibration process.


Model developed by Alejandro Fernandez based on the model in Stella(R) developed by Byron Steinman (University of Minnesota Duluth) in Steinman et al., 2010.
